# Changelog

All notable changes to VaultS3 are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
semantic-ish versioning via git tags (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Fault-injection test coverage for the three data-durability subsystems that
  previously had none:
  - **erasure** — Reed-Solomon encode/reconstruct, lost-disk reads, and the
    background healer repairing degraded objects (0% → ~64% coverage).
  - **cluster** — consistent-hash ring consistency/distribution and the
    failure-detector healthy→suspect→down→recover state machine.
  - **replication** — vector-clock causality/merge and all three conflict
    resolution strategies (last-writer-wins, largest-object, site-preference).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed
- Stopped tracking build artifacts and logs in git (`vaults3-cli`,
  `bin/vaults3-cli`, `access.log`, `test-results/`); added `*.log` and
  `test-results/` to `.gitignore`.

## [4.2.3] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- `docs/SCALING.md` operations guide: multi-disk erasure coding, multi-node
  Raft cluster setup, and lost-disk / lost-server / quorum-loss runbooks.
### Fixed
- `POST /api/v1/heal` was a stub that only acked the request; it now invokes the
  erasure healer (`Healer.Heal(bucket, prefix)`) asynchronously. (issue #5)

## [4.2.2] - 2026-06-16
### Security
- Removed esbuild from the dependency tree (Dependabot #16, GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr)
  by upgrading `vite` 6→8 and `@vitejs/plugin-react` 4→6. Vite 8 uses the
  Rolldown bundler instead of esbuild.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-06-06
### Security
- Bumped `react-router-dom` 7.13.0 → 7.17.0, clearing 6 Dependabot alerts
  (turbo-stream RCE, RSC/Location XSS, manifest/single-fetch DoS, open redirect).

## [4.2.0] - 2026-05-31
### Security
- Bumped `postcss` 8.5.6 → 8.5.15 (Dependabot, dev dependency).

## [4.1.0] - 2026-04-02
### Fixed
- Four dashboard bugs: bucket stats drift, empty file browser listing, search
  result timestamps showing 1970, and a `/dashboard/buckets/` redirect loop.
- Versioned `ListObjectsV2`/`V1` returning empty results for versioned buckets.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- "Change Admin Credentials" feature in the dashboard Settings page.
- Distributed/enterprise features: erasure coding, Raft clustering,
  active-active replication, tiering, and backup.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- SSE-KMS encryption, AMQP/PostgreSQL event notifications, and Parquet support
  for S3 Select.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- Expanded S3 API surface and dashboard features.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-25
### Added
- First public release: S3-compatible object storage server with built-in web
  dashboard, CLI, versioning, WORM, notifications, full-text search, FUSE mount,
  and multi-platform release binaries + Docker images.
