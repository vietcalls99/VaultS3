## Why VaultS3?

**MinIO** stripped the admin console from its Community Edition in mid-2025 and archived the open-source repository in February 2026 — it is no longer actively maintained, and full management now requires the paid AIStor tier. **SeaweedFS** is capable but spreads across multiple components (master / volume / filer); it does have a web admin UI (`weed admin`) and a working FUSE mount. **Garage** still has no object versioning, WORM/object-lock, or event notifications.

**VaultS3 keeps everything in one self-contained binary under 80 MB RAM:**

| | VaultS3 | MinIO | SeaweedFS | Garage |

| RAM (small deploy) | **<80 MB** | 512 MB+ | 50-200 MB | 50-150 MB |
| Single binary | **Yes** | Yes | No | Yes |
| Web dashboard | **Built-in** | Paid¹ | Yes | No |

## Production Readiness

VaultS3 is honest about what's battle-tested versus still maturing. Pick the lane that matches your risk tolerance:

| Path | Maturity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-node** (S3 API, versioning, IAM, dashboard) | ✅ Stable | The default deployment. Broad test coverage; runs in production today. |
| **Erasure coding** (single-node, multi-disk) | ✅ Stable | Reed-Solomon encode/reconstruct and the background healer have fault-injection tests (lose disks → reconstruct → heal). |
| **Tiering & backup** | ✅ Stable | Hot/cold migration, transparent promotion, and full/incremental backup are tested. Restore is a manual file copy. |
| **Multi-node Raft clustering** | 🟡 Beta | Metadata writes replicate via Raft consensus (writes accepted on any node via leader-forwarding), object data is placed/served by a live-membership hash ring, inter-node calls are authenticated, and on Kubernetes the cluster auto-forms (leader bootstrap + auto-join + self-heal). Validated end-to-end on a real 3-node cluster: leader election & failover, node recovery with catch-up, cross-node reads, and concurrent load. Still operationally newer — not yet stress/scale/multi-region hardened, so validate against your workload before trusting it as the only copy of critical data. |
| **Active-active replication** | 🟡 Beta | Vector-clock conflict resolution is unit-tested; the cross-site sync worker is less exercised in the wild. |

**Recommendation:** run single-node (optionally with erasure coding across local disks) for production data you care about, and treat clustering/active-active as advanced opt-in features you validate first. Always keep an independent backup. See the **[Scaling & Operations Guide](docs/SCALING.md)** for redundancy layering and recovery runbooks, and the **[Benchmarks guide](docs/BENCHMARKS.md)** for a reproducible way to measure throughput and RAM on your own hardware.

## Features

- **S3-compatible API** — Works with any S3 client (AWS CLI, mc, boto3, minio-js)
- **Single binary** — One file, no runtime dependencies, no Docker required
- **Low memory** — Targets <80MB RAM (vs MinIO's 300-500MB)
- **BoltDB metadata** — Embedded key-value store, no external database needed
- **S3 Signature V4** — Standard AWS authentication
- **AES-256-GCM encryption at rest** — SSE-S3 (static key) and SSE-KMS (HashiCorp Vault or local key provider) encryption modes
- **Per-bucket encryption keys** — For bucket-per-tenant setups, each bucket can be encrypted with its own key that is **not shared** with other tenants (or opt out and stay plaintext). Envelope encryption (master KEK wraps a per-bucket data key); opt in per bucket via `PUT /{bucket}?encryption` or the dashboard; supports key rotation and crypto-shredding. Enable with `encryption.per_bucket: true` — see [design doc](docs/design/per-bucket-encryption.md)
- **SSE-C (customer-provided keys)** — Operator-blind per-object encryption: the client supplies the key per request (`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-*`); the server encrypts/decrypts with it and stores only the key's MD5, never the key
- **Bucket policies** — Public-read, private, custom S3-compatible JSON policies
- **Quota management** — Per-bucket size and object count limits
- **Rate limiting** — Token bucket rate limiter per client IP and per access key to prevent abuse
- **S3 Select** — Execute SQL queries on CSV, JSON, and Parquet objects without downloading the full file
- **Multipart upload** — Full lifecycle (Create, UploadPart, UploadPartCopy, Complete, Abort, ListUploads, ListParts)
- **Bucket tagging** — S3-compatible tag sets with PUT/GET/DELETE
- **Bucket/Object ACL** — S3-compatible ACL responses (GET/PUT)
- **Multiple access keys** — Dynamic key management via BoltDB
- **Object tagging** — Up to 10 tags per object
- **Range requests** — Partial content downloads (206 responses)
- **Copy object** — Same-bucket and cross-bucket copies
- **Batch delete** — Multi-object delete with XML body
- **Virtual-hosted style URLs** — `bucket.domain/key` in addition to path-style
- **Bucket default retention** — Set default GOVERNANCE or COMPLIANCE retention on a bucket, auto-applied to new objects
- **Per-bucket Prometheus metrics** — Request counts, bytes in/out, and errors with bucket labels at `/metrics`
- **Prometheus metrics** — `/metrics` endpoint with storage, request, and runtime stats
- **Presigned URLs** — Pre-authenticated URL generation
- **Web dashboard** — Built-in React UI at `/dashboard/` with home overview page, file browser (sortable columns, pagination, file preview, metadata panel, version history panel with diff viewer/rollback/tagging, multi-select, bulk delete, bulk zip download, breadcrumb navigation), drag-and-drop file and folder upload, copy-to-clipboard buttons, access key management, activity log, storage stats with auto-refresh, read-only settings viewer, IAM management, audit trail viewer (sortable, paginated), search (sortable, paginated), notifications, replication status, lambda triggers, backup management, bucket config (versioning toggle with status indicator, lifecycle editor, CORS editor), keyboard shortcuts (`/` search, `?` help), toast notifications (success/error/info), dark/light theme, responsive layout
- **Health checks** — `/health` (liveness) and `/ready` (readiness) endpoints for load balancers and Kubernetes
- **Graceful shutdown** — Drains in-flight requests on SIGTERM/SIGINT with configurable timeout
- **TLS support** — Optional HTTPS with configurable cert/key paths
- **Object versioning** — Per-bucket versioning with version IDs, delete markers, version-specific GET/DELETE/HEAD
- **Object locking (WORM)** — Legal hold and retention (GOVERNANCE/COMPLIANCE) to prevent deletion
- **Lifecycle rules** — Per-bucket object expiration (auto-delete after N days) with background worker
- **Zstandard compression** — Transparent compress-on-write, decompress-on-read with zstd (better ratio and speed than gzip); objects written by older gzip builds are still read transparently (codec auto-detected by magic number)
- **Small-file packing (experimental)** — Optionally pack objects up to a size threshold into large append-only **volume** files (each as an independent zstd frame) with byte-offset locations in BoltDB, plus background dead-space **compaction** (`POST /api/v1/compact`) — avoids the per-file overhead (inodes, syscalls, disk blocks) of millions of tiny objects. Larger objects fall through to individual files. Not yet composable with encryption or erasure coding (skipped if either is enabled)
- **Scales to millions of objects** — Listing and storage stats are served from a sorted BoltDB metadata index with maintained per-bucket counters (size/count updated incrementally on every write), never a filesystem walk. So dashboard stats are O(1) and the object browser pages in milliseconds regardless of bucket size — verified at 1M+ objects (stats `13s → 0.4ms`)
- **Access logging** — Structured JSON lines log file of all S3 operations
- **Static website hosting** — Serve index/error documents from buckets, no auth required
- **IAM users, groups & policies** — Fine-grained access control with S3-compatible policy evaluation, default deny, wildcard matching
- **CORS per bucket** — S3-compatible CORS configuration with OPTIONS preflight support
- **STS temporary credentials** — Short-lived access keys with configurable TTL, auto-cleanup of expired keys
- **Audit trail** — Persistent audit log with filtering by user, bucket, time range; auto-pruning via lifecycle worker
- **IP allowlist/blocklist** — Global and per-user CIDR-based IP restrictions with IPv4/IPv6 support
- **S3 event notifications** — Per-bucket webhook notifications on object mutations with event type and key prefix/suffix filtering, plus Kafka, NATS, Redis, AMQP/RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch backends
- **Raft clustering** — Multi-node cluster with Hashicorp Raft consensus for strongly consistent distributed metadata, automatic leader election, and node join/leave via HTTP API
- **Consistent hashing** — xxhash64-based hash ring with virtual nodes for automatic data placement and request routing across cluster nodes via reverse proxy
- **Erasure coding** — Reed-Solomon encoding (configurable data/parity shards) for disk-failure protection with background healer that auto-reconstructs degraded objects
- **High availability** — Automatic failure detection (health probes with suspect/down state machine), failover proxy routing to healthy replicas, and background rebalancer for membership changes
- **Scalable listing** — Object listing is served from the sorted BoltDB metadata index (seek to the page, `O(log n + page_size)`), so `ListObjectsV2` page latency stays flat (~0.7 ms per 1000-key page) whether a prefix holds a thousand or **a hundred million** objects (measured, not extrapolated) — no full-bucket scan
  - 📖 See the **[Scaling & Operations Guide](docs/SCALING.md)** for multi-disk erasure coding, multi-node cluster setup, large-prefix listing, and lost-disk / lost-server recovery runbooks
- **Active-active replication** — Bidirectional site-to-site sync with vector clocks for causal ordering, pluggable conflict resolution (last-writer-wins, largest-object, site-preference), and change log for efficient delta sync
- **Async replication** — One-way async replication to peer VaultS3 instances with BoltDB-backed queue, retry with exponential backoff, and loop prevention
- **CLI tool** — Standalone `vaults3-cli` binary for bucket, object, user, and replication management without AWS CLI
- **Presigned upload restrictions** — Enforce max file size, content type whitelist, and key prefix on presigned PUT URLs
- **Full-text search** — In-memory search index over object metadata, tags, content type, and key patterns with incremental updates
- **Semantic / vector search (optional)** — Embeds object text via any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, llama.cpp, OpenAI…) and serves similarity search + RAG retrieval from `POST /api/v1/vectors/query` — all in the single binary, no external vector database. Searchable from the dashboard (Keyword / Semantic toggle)
- **Migrate from S3** — Import buckets and objects from MinIO, AWS S3, or any S3-compatible source via a dashboard wizard (test connection → pick buckets → live progress, cancel in-flight jobs); **preserves each object's original modified date, user metadata, and content headers** plus **bucket policies and tags** (a faithful copy, not a same-day re-upload — something `mc mirror` can't do since it writes via PutObject); streams objects (no in-memory buffering) and retries transient errors, no AWS SDK required
- **Cost estimator** — A dashboard panel that estimates what your stored data would cost on AWS S3, GCS, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, and Wasabi (storage + egress) vs. self-hosting — egress-free — for free (`GET /api/v1/tco`)
- **Bucket snapshots ("git-for-buckets")** — Capture a bucket's state, diff against the live bucket, and roll back in one click (commit / diff / restore) — git-style history for your data, built on versioning with no external stack. Restore even resurrects deleted objects, and is itself reversible
- **Webhook virus scanning** — POST uploaded objects to a configurable scan endpoint (ClamAV, VirusTotal, etc.) with quarantine bucket for infected files
- **Data tiering** — Automatic hot/cold storage migration based on access patterns with transparent reads and manual migration API
- **Backup scheduler** — Scheduled full/incremental backups to local directory targets with cron-like scheduling and backup history
- **Git-like versioning** — Visual diff between object versions (text and binary), version tagging with labels, one-click rollback to any version
- **FUSE mount** — Mount VaultS3 buckets as local filesystem directories with read/write support, lazy loading, and SigV4 authentication. LRU block cache (256KB blocks, configurable size), metadata cache with TTL, kernel attribute caching, and SigV4 derived key caching for fast repeated reads
- **OIDC/JWT SSO** — Sign in to the dashboard with external identity providers (Google, Keycloak, Auth0) via OpenID Connect. RS256 JWT verification with JWKS auto-discovery and caching. Email domain filtering, auto-create users, OIDC group to policy mapping.

- **CORS origin validation** — Dashboard API restricts Access-Control-Allow-Origin to same-origin and localhost (replaces wildcard `*`)
- **Dashboard API rate limiting** — Uses existing token bucket rate limiter on `/api/v1/` endpoints, returns 429 when exceeded
- **Input validation** — DNS-compatible bucket name validation (3-63 chars, lowercase, no leading/trailing hyphen) and object key validation (max 1024 chars, no null bytes)

```bash
make build
```

### Run

```bash
./vaults3
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:9000` by default.

### Configure

Edit `configs/vaults3.yaml`:

```yaml

### Encryption at Rest

VaultS3 supports two encryption modes:

**SSE-S3 (Static Key)** — Simple setup with a hex-encoded 32-byte key:

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: true
  key: ""  # 64-char hex string: openssl rand -hex 32
```

**SSE-KMS (Key Management Service)** — Per-object encryption with KMS-managed data encryption keys:

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: true
  kms:
    enabled: true
    provider: "vault"          # "vault" (HashiCorp Vault) or "local" (fallback)
    vault_addr: "http://vault:8200"
    vault_token: "hvs.xxx"
    key_name: "vaults3-dek"    # Transit engine key name
    local_key: ""              # hex-encoded fallback key (when provider: "local")
```

SSE-KMS fetches data encryption keys from HashiCorp Vault's Transit engine, caches them in memory, and supports key rotation. All objects are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a random nonce per object.

### Virtual-Hosted Style URLs

Set `server.domain` to enable virtual-hosted style access:

```yaml
server:
  domain: "s3.example.com"
```

This enables `bucket-name.s3.example.com/key` in addition to the default `s3.example.com/bucket-name/key` path-style.

### Prometheus Metrics

Access metrics at `GET /metrics`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/metrics
```

Exposes: request counts by method, bytes in/out, per-bucket storage size and object counts, per-bucket request/bytes/error counters, quota usage, Go runtime stats (goroutines, memory, GC).

### Web Dashboard

The built-in dashboard is available at `http://localhost:9000/dashboard/`. Login with your admin credentials. Features:

- Bucket browser — list, create, delete buckets
- Bucket detail — view/edit policies and quotas
- File browser — list, upload (drag & drop files and folders), download, delete objects with folder navigation, multi-select with bulk delete and bulk zip download, copy-to-clipboard for S3 URIs and keys
- Access key management — create, list, revoke S3 API keys
- IAM management — users, groups, policies CRUD with attach/detach operations
- Audit trail — filter by user, bucket, time range with auto-refresh
- Search — full-text search across all buckets by key, content type, tags
- Notifications — view webhook notification configurations
- Replication — peer status cards, pending queue table
- Lambda triggers — status overview, trigger table with event filtering
- Backups — status cards, history table, manual trigger button
- Activity log — real-time S3 operation feed with auto-refresh
- Storage stats — total storage, per-bucket breakdown, runtime metrics, auto-refresh toggle (30s)
- Migrate — import buckets from any S3-compatible source with live progress and a Cancel button for in-flight jobs
- Version indicator — the running version is shown at the bottom of the sidebar, with an "update available" hint linking to releases
- Dark/light theme — toggle with system preference detection
- Responsive layout — mobile-friendly with collapsible sidebar
- JWT-based authentication (24h tokens)

The dashboard is embedded into the binary — no separate web server needed.

### Health Checks

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/health   # liveness: {"status":"ok","uptime":"5h23m"}
curl http://localhost:9000/ready    # readiness: checks BoltDB, returns 503 if unhealthy
```

### TLS

Enable HTTPS by providing cert and key files:

```yaml
server:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    cert_file: "/path/to/cert.pem"
    key_file: "/path/to/key.pem"
```

### Docker

```bash
# From Docker Hub
docker pull eniz1806/vaults3
docker run -p 9000:9000 \
  -e VAULTS3_ACCESS_KEY=myadmin \
  -e VAULTS3_SECRET_KEY=mysupersecret \
  -v ./data:/data -v ./metadata:/metadata \
  eniz1806/vaults3

# Or build locally
docker build -t vaults3 .
docker run -p 9000:9000 -v ./data:/data -v ./metadata:/metadata vaults3
```

Images are automatically published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/eniz1806/vaults3) on every push to `main`.

#### Environment Variables

All settings can be overridden via environment variables (takes precedence over config file):

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VAULTS3_ACCESS_KEY` | Admin access key | `vaults3-admin` |
| `VAULTS3_SECRET_KEY` | Admin secret key | `vaults3-secret-change-me` |
| `VAULTS3_PORT` | Server port | `9000` |
| `VAULTS3_ADDRESS` | Bind address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `VAULTS3_DOMAIN` | Domain for virtual-hosted URLs | _(empty)_ |
| `VAULTS3_DATA_DIR` | Object storage directory | `./data` |
| `VAULTS3_METADATA_DIR` | BoltDB metadata directory | `./metadata` |
| `VAULTS3_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-char hex key (enables encryption) | _(disabled)_ |
| `VAULTS3_TLS_CERT` | TLS certificate file path | _(disabled)_ |
| `VAULTS3_TLS_KEY` | TLS private key file path | _(disabled)_ |
| `VAULTS3_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) | `info` |

### Storage requirements

VaultS3 stores each object as a regular **file** under `data_dir` and keeps
metadata in a **BoltDB** file under `metadata_dir`, so both must point at a
**mounted filesystem** — not a raw block device. Format the disk first (**XFS
recommended**; `ext4` also works) and mount it, then point `data_dir` at a
directory on the mount. This is the same model as MinIO.

- One file per object means a filesystem with plenty of inodes (XFS handles this
  well). For workloads with millions of tiny objects, enable the experimental
  [small-file packing](#small-file-packing-experimental) mode to pack them into
  large volume files and cut per-file overhead.
- On Kubernetes, a CSI driver like **DirectPV** is a good fit — it formats disks
  with XFS and presents them as mounted PVCs, which is exactly what VaultS3 wants.

### Kubernetes

Deploy with the bundled **Helm chart** or a single **plain-manifest** quickstart
(both under [`deploy/`](deploy/)):

```bash
# Helm (configurable, production-grade)
helm install vaults3 ./deploy/helm/vaults3 \
  --namespace vaults3 --create-namespace \
  --set auth.secretKey="$(openssl rand -hex 20)"

# Or plain manifests (single-node, no Helm)
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/quickstart.yaml
```

Both deploy a StatefulSet (S3 API + dashboard on port `9000`), admin keys via a
Secret, `vaults3.yaml` via a ConfigMap, persistent volumes for `/data` and
`/metadata`, liveness/readiness probes (`/health`, `/ready`), and an optional
Ingress + Prometheus ServiceMonitor. See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md)
and the [chart reference](deploy/helm/vaults3/README.md).

The Helm chart can also **auto-form a Raft cluster** (Beta) with
`--set cluster.enabled=true --set replicaCount=3`: pod-0 bootstraps as leader and
the others auto-join, with self-healing on pod restart. Metadata writes replicate
across nodes via Raft consensus (a write to any node is forwarded to the leader),
so the cluster stays consistent. Clustering is functional but newer than
single-node + erasure coding, which remains the recommendation for maximum
production durability.

For backup/restore workflows, the chart also supports a single-node **Deployment**
mode (`controller.kind=Deployment`) and **existing PVCs**
(`persistence.data.existingClaim`), so you can mount a claim restored from Velero,
k8up, or a CSI snapshot — see the [chart reference](deploy/helm/vaults3/README.md#backups--restore).

### Object Versioning

Enable versioning on a bucket to keep multiple versions of objects:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3', endpoint_url='http://localhost:9000',
    aws_access_key_id='vaults3-admin',
    aws_secret_access_key='vaults3-secret-change-me')

# Enable versioning
s3.put_bucket_versioning(Bucket='my-bucket',
    VersioningConfiguration={'Status': 'Enabled'})

# Upload creates a new version each time
s3.put_object(Bucket='my-bucket', Key='file.txt', Body=b'v1')
s3.put_object(Bucket='my-bucket', Key='file.txt', Body=b'v2')

# Get specific version
s3.get_object(Bucket='my-bucket', Key='file.txt', VersionId='...')

# Delete creates a delete marker (versions preserved)
s3.delete_object(Bucket='my-bucket', Key='file.txt')

# Permanently delete a specific version
s3.delete_object(Bucket='my-bucket', Key='file.txt', VersionId='...')
```

### Object Locking (WORM)

Protect objects from deletion with legal holds or retention policies:

```python
# Legal hold — prevents deletion regardless
s3.put_object_legal_hold(Bucket='my-bucket', Key='file.txt', VersionId='...',
    LegalHold={'Status': 'ON'})

# Retention — prevents deletion until date
s3.put_object_retention(Bucket='my-bucket', Key='file.txt', VersionId='...',
    Retention={'Mode': 'COMPLIANCE', 'RetainUntilDate': '2030-01-01T00:00:00Z'})
```

### Lifecycle Rules

Auto-delete objects after a specified number of days:

```python
s3.put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration(Bucket='my-bucket',
    LifecycleConfiguration={
        'Rules': [{
            'ID': 'expire-logs',
            'Expiration': {'Days': 30},
            'Filter': {'Prefix': 'logs/'},
            'Status': 'Enabled',
        }]
    })
```

The background worker scans objects periodically (configurable interval, default 1 hour) and deletes expired objects. Locked objects (legal hold or retention) are skipped.

### Compression

Enable zstd compression to reduce storage usage:

```yaml
compression:
  enabled: true
```

All objects are transparently compressed (zstd) on write and decompressed on read; objects written by older gzip builds are still read correctly. Works with encryption (data is compressed then encrypted on disk).

### Small-file packing (experimental)

For workloads with huge numbers of tiny objects, packing stores small objects as
independent zstd frames inside large append-only **volume** files (with byte-offset
locations in BoltDB) instead of one file per object — avoiding per-file overhead.
Objects larger than `max_object_size` are stored as individual files as usual.

```yaml
packing:
  enabled: true
  max_object_size: 1048576       # objects this size (bytes) or smaller are packed
  volume_max_size: 1073741824    # roll to a new volume past this size
  compact_interval_hours: 24     # background dead-space reclamation; 0 = disabled
  compact_min_dead_ratio: 0.5    # compact a volume once half of it is dead space
```

Deleted/overwritten objects leave dead space in volumes; it is reclaimed by
background compaction (or on demand via `POST /api/v1/compact`). Packing is
**experimental** and does not yet compose with encryption or erasure coding (it is
skipped, with a warning, if either is enabled).

### Access Logging

Enable structured JSON access logs:

```yaml
logging:
  enabled: true
  file_path: "./access.log"
```

Each S3 operation is logged as a JSON line with timestamp, method, bucket, key, status code, bytes, and client IP.

### Static Website Hosting

Serve static websites directly from buckets:

```python
s3.put_bucket_website(Bucket='my-site',
    WebsiteConfiguration={
        'IndexDocument': {'Suffix': 'index.html'},
        'ErrorDocument': {'Key': 'error.html'}
    })
```

Website-enabled buckets serve `index.html` for directory paths and a custom error page for missing objects. No authentication required for GET/HEAD requests.

### IAM (Users, Groups & Policies)

Fine-grained access control with S3-compatible IAM policies:

```python
import requests, json

API = "http://localhost:9000/api/v1"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <jwt-token>", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Create an IAM user
requests.post(f"{API}/iam/users", headers=headers, json={"name": "alice"})

# Attach a built-in policy (ReadOnlyAccess, ReadWriteAccess, FullAccess)
requests.post(f"{API}/iam/users/alice/policies", headers=headers,
    json={"policyName": "ReadOnlyAccess"})

# Create an access key for the user
resp = requests.post(f"{API}/keys", headers=headers, json={"userId": "alice"})
key = resp.json()  # {"accessKey": "...", "secretKey": "..."}

# Create groups and attach policies
requests.post(f"{API}/iam/groups", headers=headers, json={"name": "developers"})
requests.post(f"{API}/iam/groups/developers/policies", headers=headers,
    json={"policyName": "ReadWriteAccess"})

# Add user to group
requests.post(f"{API}/iam/users/alice/groups", headers=headers,
    json={"groupName": "developers"})

# Create custom policies
custom_policy = json.dumps({
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"]
    }]
})
requests.post(f"{API}/iam/policies", headers=headers,
    json={"name": "MyBucketReadOnly", "document": custom_policy})
```

Policy evaluation follows AWS IAM semantics: default deny, explicit Allow required, explicit Deny always wins. Admin keys and legacy keys (without a user) retain full access.

### CORS per Bucket

Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing on a per-bucket basis:

```python
s3.put_bucket_cors(Bucket='my-bucket', CORSConfiguration={
    'CORSRules': [{
        'AllowedOrigins': ['https://example.com'],
        'AllowedMethods': ['GET', 'PUT'],
        'AllowedHeaders': ['*'],
        'MaxAgeSeconds': 3600,
    }]
})
```

The server responds to `OPTIONS` preflight requests with the configured CORS headers. Unknown origins are rejected with 403.

### STS Temporary Credentials

Issue short-lived access keys for temporary access:

```python
import requests, boto3

API = "http://localhost:9000/api/v1"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <jwt-token>", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Create temporary credentials for an IAM user (max 12 hours)
resp = requests.post(f"{API}/sts/session-token", headers=headers,
    json={"durationSecs": 3600, "userId": "alice"})
creds = resp.json()  # {"accessKey", "secretKey", "sessionToken", "expiration"}

# Use temporary credentials with any S3 client
s3 = boto3.client("s3", endpoint_url="http://localhost:9000",
    aws_access_key_id=creds["accessKey"],
    aws_secret_access_key=creds["secretKey"])
```

Temporary keys inherit the IAM user's policies. Expired keys are automatically cleaned up by the lifecycle worker.

### Audit Trail

Query the persistent audit log of all S3 operations:

```python
# List recent audit entries
requests.get(f"{API}/audit?limit=50", headers=headers)

# Filter by user, time range, or bucket
requests.get(f"{API}/audit?user=alice&limit=10", headers=headers)
requests.get(f"{API}/audit?from=1700000000&to=1700100000", headers=headers)
requests.get(f"{API}/audit?bucket=my-bucket", headers=headers)
```

Each entry records: timestamp, principal, user ID, action, resource, effect (Allow/Deny), source IP, and status code. Old entries are automatically pruned based on `security.audit_retention_days`.

### IP Restrictions

Control access by IP address at global or per-user level:

```yaml
# Global restrictions in config
security:
  ip_allowlist: ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.0.0/16"]  # empty = allow all
  ip_blocklist: ["10.0.0.99/32"]  # deny always wins
```

```python
# Per-user IP restrictions via API
requests.put(f"{API}/iam/users/alice/ip-restrictions", headers=headers,
    json={"allowedCidrs": ["10.0.0.0/8", "::1/128"]})

# Clear restrictions (allow from anywhere)
requests.put(f"{API}/iam/users/alice/ip-restrictions", headers=headers,
    json={"allowedCidrs": []})
```

Evaluation order: global blocklist (deny wins) → global allowlist → per-user allowlist. Admin keys are exempt from IP restrictions. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR notation.

### S3 Event Notifications

Configure webhooks on buckets to receive notifications when objects are created or deleted:

```python
from botocore.auth import SigV4Auth
from botocore.credentials import Credentials
from botocore.awsrequest import AWSRequest
import requests

# PUT notification configuration (S3-compatible XML)
notif_xml = b"""<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<NotificationConfiguration>
  <TopicConfiguration>
    <Id>my-webhook</Id>
    <Topic>https://example.com/webhook</Topic>
    <Event>s3:ObjectCreated:*</Event>
    <Event>s3:ObjectRemoved:*</Event>
    <Filter>
      <S3Key>
        <FilterRule>
          <Name>prefix</Name>
          <Value>images/</Value>
        </FilterRule>
      </S3Key>
    </Filter>
  </TopicConfiguration>
</NotificationConfiguration>"""

# Sign and send (using botocore for SigV4)
url = "http://localhost:9000/my-bucket?notification"
creds = Credentials("vaults3-admin", "vaults3-secret-change-me")
req = AWSRequest(method="PUT", url=url, data=notif_xml,
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/xml"})
SigV4Auth(creds, "s3", "us-east-1").add_auth(req)
requests.put(url, headers=dict(req.headers), data=notif_xml)
```

Supported events: `s3:ObjectCreated:Put`, `s3:ObjectCreated:Copy`, `s3:ObjectCreated:CompleteMultipartUpload`, `s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete`. Use wildcards like `s3:ObjectCreated:*`. Webhook payloads follow the AWS S3 event notification JSON format.

Configure webhook delivery in `configs/vaults3.yaml`:

```yaml
notifications:
  max_workers: 4       # concurrent webhook delivery goroutines
  queue_size: 256      # buffered event queue size
  timeout_secs: 10     # webhook HTTP timeout
  max_retries: 3       # retry attempts for failed webhooks
  kafka:
    enabled: true
    brokers: ["localhost:9092"]
    topic: "vaults3-events"
  nats:
    enabled: true
    url: "nats://localhost:4222"
    subject: "vaults3.events"
  redis:
    enabled: true
    addr: "localhost:6379"
    channel: "vaults3-events"   # pub/sub mode
    list_key: ""                # set for LPUSH queue mode
  amqp:
    enabled: true
    url: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/"
    exchange: "vaults3-events"
    routing_key: "s3.events"
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    dsn: "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/vaults3?sslmode=disable"
    table: "s3_events"
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true
    urls: ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index: "vaults3-events"
```

Additional backends: **AMQP/RabbitMQ** (publish to exchanges), **PostgreSQL** (insert into table), **Elasticsearch** (index events). In addition to per-bucket webhooks, you can enable global notification backends. All S3 events are published to every enabled backend. Multiple backends can be active simultaneously. Disabled backends add zero overhead.

### Async Replication

Replicate objects to a peer VaultS3 instance automatically:

```yaml
replication:
  enabled: true
  peers:
    - name: "dc2"
      url: "http://peer-vaults3:9000"
      access_key: "peer-admin"
      secret_key: "peer-secret"
  scan_interval_secs: 30   # queue processing interval
  max_retries: 5           # retry before dead-letter
  batch_size: 100          # events per scan cycle
```

Objects created, copied, or deleted on the primary — whether through the S3 API **or the web dashboard** — are asynchronously pushed to all configured peers over the S3 protocol. Buckets are auto-created on peers. Failed deliveries retry with exponential backoff (5s, 15s, 45s, 135s, 405s). The `X-VaultS3-Replication` header prevents infinite loops. Monitor via dashboard API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/replication/status   # per-peer sync stats
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/replication/queue     # pending queue entries
```

For one-way push, replication only needs to be enabled on the **source**. The **target** does not need `replication.enabled` — it just needs the peer `access_key`/`secret_key` (from the source's config) to be valid credentials on it. Enable replication on both sides only for `mode: active-active`.

### CLI Tool

VaultS3 includes a standalone CLI binary (`vaults3-cli`) for managing the server:

```bash
# Set credentials via environment or flags
export VAULTS3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
export VAULTS3_ACCESS_KEY=vaults3-admin
export VAULTS3_SECRET_KEY=vaults3-secret-change-me

# Bucket operations
vaults3-cli bucket list
vaults3-cli bucket create my-bucket
vaults3-cli bucket info my-bucket
vaults3-cli bucket delete my-bucket

# Object operations
vaults3-cli object put my-bucket docs/readme.md ./README.md
vaults3-cli object ls my-bucket --prefix=docs/
vaults3-cli object get my-bucket docs/readme.md ./downloaded.md
vaults3-cli object cp my-bucket/file.txt my-bucket/copy.txt
vaults3-cli object rm my-bucket docs/readme.md
vaults3-cli object presign my-bucket file.txt --expires=3600

# IAM user operations
vaults3-cli user list
vaults3-cli user create alice --access-key=ak --secret-key=sk
vaults3-cli user attach-policy alice ReadWriteAccess
vaults3-cli user delete alice

# Replication monitoring
vaults3-cli replication status
vaults3-cli replication queue
```

Build both binaries with `make build` or just the CLI with `make cli`.

### Presigned Upload Restrictions

Generate presigned PUT URLs with server-enforced restrictions:

```python
import requests

API = "http://localhost:9000/api/v1"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <jwt-token>", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Generate restricted presigned PUT URL
resp = requests.post(f"{API}/presign", headers=headers, json={
    "bucket": "uploads",
    "key": "images/photo.jpg",
    "method": "PUT",
    "expires": 3600,
    "maxSize": 10485760,               # 10MB max
    "allowTypes": "image/jpeg,image/png",  # only images
    "requirePrefix": "images/"         # must upload to images/
})
url = resp.json()["url"]

# Upload within restrictions — succeeds
requests.put(url, data=image_data, headers={"Content-Type": "image/jpeg"})

# Upload too large / wrong type / wrong prefix — 403 Forbidden
```

Restriction parameters (`X-Vault-MaxSize`, `X-Vault-AllowTypes`, `X-Vault-RequirePrefix`) are embedded in the signed URL and validated server-side.

### Full-Text Search

Search objects by key, content type, and tags across all buckets:

```bash
# Search by key substring
curl "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/search?q=readme" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Search by content type
curl "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/search?q=type:image" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Search by tag
curl "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/search?q=tag:project=vaults3" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Filter by bucket and limit results
curl "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/search?q=docs&bucket=my-bucket&limit=10" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

The search index is built on startup from BoltDB metadata and updated incrementally on every object put, delete, copy, and tag change. Supports plain text (substring match), `type:` prefix for content-type filtering, and `tag:key=value` for tag matching.

### Webhook Virus Scanning

Scan uploaded objects with an external virus scanner (ClamAV REST, VirusTotal, etc.):

```yaml
scanner:
  enabled: true
  webhook_url: "http://localhost:3310/scan"
  timeout_secs: 30
  quarantine_bucket: "vaults3-quarantine"
  fail_closed: false          # false=fail-open (keep file), true=quarantine on error
  max_scan_size_bytes: 104857600  # 100MB
  workers: 2
```

When enabled, every uploaded object is POSTed to the webhook URL as multipart/form-data. If the scanner returns 406/403 (infected), the object is moved to the quarantine bucket and deleted from the original. Monitor via dashboard API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/scanner/status       # queue depth + recent scans
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/scanner/quarantine    # quarantined objects
```

### Data Tiering

Automatically migrate infrequently accessed objects to a cold storage directory:

```yaml
tiering:
  enabled: true
  cold_data_dir: "./cold_data"
  migrate_after_days: 30
  scan_interval_secs: 3600
```

Objects not accessed for `migrate_after_days` are moved to the cold data directory. On read, cold objects are transparently served and promoted back to hot storage. Manual migration is available via API:

```bash
# Check tiering status (hot/cold counts and sizes)
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/tiering/status -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Manually migrate an object to cold tier
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/v1/tiering/migrate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bucket":"my-bucket","key":"archive/old-file.zip","direction":"cold"}'
```

### Backup Scheduler

Schedule automatic backups to local directories:

```yaml
backup:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    - name: "local-backup"
      type: "local"
      path: "/backups/vaults3"
  schedule_cron: "0 2 * * *"   # daily at 2am
  retention_days: 30
  incremental: false            # true for incremental backups
```

Monitor and trigger backups via API:

```bash
# Check backup status
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/backups/status -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# List backup history
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/backups -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Trigger immediate backup
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/v1/backups/trigger -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Incremental backups only copy objects modified since the last successful backup. Full backups mirror the complete object store.

### Git-like Versioning

Compare, tag, and rollback object versions:

```bash
# Diff two versions (text files show line-by-line diff, binary shows metadata only)
curl "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/versions/diff?bucket=my-bucket&key=file.txt&v1=VERSION_A&v2=VERSION_B" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Tag a version with a label
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/v1/versions/tags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bucket":"my-bucket","key":"file.txt","versionId":"VERSION_ID","tag":"v1.0"}'

# List tags for an object
curl "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/versions/tags?bucket=my-bucket&key=file.txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Delete a tag
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/versions/tags?bucket=my-bucket&key=file.txt&tag=v1.0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Rollback to a specific version (copies old version content as latest)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/v1/versions/rollback \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bucket":"my-bucket","key":"file.txt","versionId":"VERSION_ID"}'
```

Text diffs use LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) to produce unified diffs with add/remove/equal lines. Binary files show only size and metadata differences.

### FUSE Mount

Mount a VaultS3 bucket as a local filesystem directory:

```bash
# Mount a bucket (requires macFUSE on macOS or FUSE on Linux)
vaults3-cli mount my-bucket /mnt/vaults3

# Browse files
ls /mnt/vaults3
cat /mnt/vaults3/docs/readme.txt

# Write files (creates objects in VaultS3)
echo "hello" > /mnt/vaults3/new-file.txt

# Unmount
# Press Ctrl+C in the mount terminal, or:
fusermount -u /mnt/vaults3
```

FUSE mount uses range requests for lazy loading — only the requested bytes are fetched from the server. Write support buffers data and uploads on file close.

### S3 Select (SQL on Objects)

Execute SQL queries on CSV and JSON objects without downloading the full file:

```python
from botocore.auth import SigV4Auth
from botocore.credentials import Credentials
from botocore.awsrequest import AWSRequest
import requests

# Query a CSV file
url = "http://localhost:9000/my-bucket/data.csv?select&select-type=2"
body = b"""<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SelectObjectContentRequest>
    <Expression>SELECT name, age FROM s3object WHERE city = 'New York' AND age > '25'</Expression>
    <ExpressionType>SQL</ExpressionType>
    <InputSerialization><CSV><FileHeaderInfo>USE</FileHeaderInfo></CSV></InputSerialization>
    <OutputSerialization><JSON/></OutputSerialization>
</SelectObjectContentRequest>"""

creds = Credentials("vaults3-admin", "vaults3-secret-change-me")
req = AWSRequest(method="POST", url=url, data=body, headers={"Content-Type": "application/xml"})
SigV4Auth(creds, "s3", "us-east-1").add_auth(req)
r = requests.post(url, headers=dict(req.headers), data=body)
# Returns JSON lines: {"name":"Alice","age":"30"}\n{"name":"Charlie","age":"35"}
```

Supported SQL features:
- `SELECT *` or `SELECT col1, col2` (column projection)
- `FROM s3object` (required table name)
- `WHERE col = 'value'`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (comparisons, numeric-aware)
- `AND` / `OR` (logical operators)
- `LIKE 'pattern%'` (SQL wildcards: `%` = any chars, `_` = single char)
- `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`
- `LIMIT N`
- Column references: `name`, `s3object.name`, `s.name`, `_1` (positional for CSV without headers)

Input formats: CSV (with/without headers, custom delimiters), JSON Lines, JSON Document (array), Parquet (columnar format via parquet-go).
Compressed input: GZIP and BZIP2 compressed CSV/JSON files are transparently decompressed before query execution.
Output formats: JSON (one object per line) or CSV.

### Bucket Default Retention

Set default object retention on a versioned bucket — all new objects automatically inherit the retention policy:

```python
from botocore.auth import SigV4Auth
from botocore.credentials import Credentials
from botocore.awsrequest import AWSRequest
import requests

# Set default retention (requires versioning enabled)
url = "http://localhost:9000/my-bucket?object-lock"
body = b"""<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ObjectLockConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <DefaultRetention>
      <Mode>GOVERNANCE</Mode>
      <Days>30</Days>
    </DefaultRetention>
  </Rule>
</ObjectLockConfiguration>"""

creds = Credentials("vaults3-admin", "vaults3-secret-change-me")
req = AWSRequest(method="PUT", url=url, data=body, headers={"Content-Type": "application/xml"})
SigV4Auth(creds, "s3", "us-east-1").add_auth(req)
requests.put(url, headers=dict(req.headers), data=body)

# All new objects now get 30-day GOVERNANCE retention automatically
s3.put_object(Bucket='my-bucket', Key='file.txt', Body=b'protected')
# file.txt cannot be deleted for 30 days
```

Modes: `GOVERNANCE` (admin can bypass with special header) or `COMPLIANCE` (nobody can shorten/remove until expiry). Requires versioning to be enabled on the bucket.

### Per-Bucket Prometheus Metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint includes per-bucket counters (limited to top 100 buckets):

```
vaults3_bucket_requests_total{bucket="my-bucket",method="PUT"} 42
vaults3_bucket_requests_total{bucket="my-bucket",method="GET"} 156
vaults3_bucket_bytes_in_total{bucket="my-bucket"} 10485760
vaults3_bucket_bytes_out_total{bucket="my-bucket"} 52428800
vaults3_bucket_errors_total{bucket="my-bucket"} 3
```

These complement the existing global metrics and per-bucket storage metrics, enabling monitoring and alerting per bucket.

### Rate Limiting

Protect against abuse and DDoS with token bucket rate limiting:

```yaml
rate_limit:
  enabled: true
  requests_per_sec: 100   # per client IP
  burst_size: 200
  per_key_rps: 50         # per access key
  per_key_burst: 100
```

When enabled, each client IP and access key gets an independent token bucket. Requests exceeding the limit receive `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After: 1` header. Stale buckets are cleaned up after 5 minutes of inactivity.

```bash
# Check rate limiter status
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/ratelimit/status -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Test with mc (MinIO Client)

```bash
mc alias set vaults3 http://localhost:9000 vaults3-admin vaults3-secret-change-me
mc mb vaults3/my-bucket
mc cp file.txt vaults3/my-bucket/
mc ls vaults3/my-bucket/
mc cat vaults3/my-bucket/file.txt
```

## Security

VaultS3 is designed with security in mind:

- **S3 Signature V4** — full signature verification including presigned URLs
- **Presigned URL validation** — signature, expiry, and restrictions enforced server-side
- **Constant-time credential comparison** — `crypto/hmac.Equal` prevents timing attacks on login
- **Path traversal protection** — `..` segments rejected at S3, API, versioning API, CopyObject/UploadPartCopy source, and filesystem layers
- **SSRF prevention** — webhook, lambda, and notification URLs blocked from targeting localhost, private IPs, and cloud metadata endpoints
- **Upload size limits** — 5GB per PUT (S3 spec), enforced with `http.MaxBytesReader`
- **Rate limiting** — per-IP token bucket using `RemoteAddr` (not spoofable via `X-Forwarded-For`)
- **AES-256-GCM encryption at rest** — SSE-S3 (static key) and SSE-KMS (HashiCorp Vault / local key) modes
- **IAM with default-deny** — policy evaluation engine with wildcard matching
- **Security headers** — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy
- **Non-root Docker** — container runs as `vaults3` user (UID 1000)
- **Default credential warning** — startup log warns if admin credentials haven't been changed
- **Error message sanitization** — OIDC and health check errors return generic messages, preventing internal detail leaking
- **Race condition safety** — Replication handler creates per-request struct copy instead of mutating shared state
- **UploadID validation** — Hex-only regex validation prevents path traversal via crafted multipart upload IDs
- **Bounded request bodies** — All JSON API endpoints use `readJSON()` with 1MB `io.LimitReader`; bucket policy body capped at 1MB
- **OIDC SSRF prevention** — Issuer URL validated against loopback, private, and link-local addresses before JWKS discovery
- **IPv6-safe rate limiting** — Uses `net.SplitHostPort` for correct IP extraction from IPv6 `[::1]:port` addresses
- **OIDC authorization layer** — Dashboard admin routes (IAM, keys, STS, audit, settings, lambda, backups) restricted to admin user; OIDC users get read-only access
- **Encryption size cap** — 1GB max object size for encrypted reads/writes prevents OOM from 3x RAM amplification
- **Compression size cap** — 1GB max decompressed size prevents decompression-bomb DoS (gzip/zstd)
- **Version path traversal protection** — `versionId` parameter validated against directory escape in version storage
- **BatchDelete lock enforcement** — Batch delete respects WORM/legal-hold and validates keys against path traversal
- **SigV4 timestamp validation** — Requests with `X-Amz-Date` skewed more than 15 minutes are rejected (prevents replay)
- **Presigned URL expiry cap** — Maximum 7 days (604800 seconds), matching AWS behavior
- **Atomic file writes** — PutObject writes to temp file then renames, preventing corruption from concurrent writes
- **Backup scheduler thread safety** — Atomic bool prevents concurrent backup races
- **OIDC admin name reservation** — OIDC users cannot claim the "admin" username
- **OIDC domain validation enforcement** — Tokens without email are rejected when domain filtering is enabled
- **CORS port restriction** — Localhost CORS only allowed on the server's own port
- **Presigned URL credential isolation** — Presigned URLs use a dedicated non-admin key, preventing privilege escalation
- **CORS Host header protection** — Origin validation uses configured server address, not attacker-controlled Host header
- **Admin-only route expansion** — Backup, replication, scanner, and tiering endpoints restricted to admin users
- **Replication queue limit cap** — Queue listing capped at 1000 entries to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Backup path traversal protection** — Backup target validates resolved paths stay within base directory
- **LIKE pattern O(n*m) matching** — Iterative DP algorithm replaces recursive backtracking, preventing ReDoS
- **Tiering promotion safety** — Async cold-to-hot promotion re-checks tier state and orders operations safely
- **Lambda output key validation** — Output key template expansion validated against path traversal
- **S3 Select record cap** — JSON/CSV parsing capped at 1M records to prevent memory exhaustion
- **FUSE cache size caps** — Signature cache, HEAD cache, and LIST cache bounded to prevent unbounded memory growth
- **GetObjectAttributes version support** — Respects `versionId` parameter and handles delete markers
- **LDAP authentication** — Bind-based LDAP/LDAPS with group-to-policy mapping and TLS support
- **External auth webhook** — Delegate authentication to an external HTTP endpoint with request validation
- **KMS envelope encryption** — HashiCorp Vault and local key provider for data encryption key management
- **Auto-TLS** — Automatic Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning with self-signed fallback
- **PROXY protocol v1** — Real client IP extraction behind PROXY protocol-aware load balancers
- **Governance bypass protection** — `x-amz-bypass-governance-retention` restricted to authorized principals
- **IAM policy conditions** — `StringEquals`, `StringLike`, `IpAddress`, `DateLessThan` condition evaluation
- **Bucket bandwidth throttling** — Per-bucket upload/download rate limits prevent resource monopolization
- **POST policy validation** — HTML form upload policies validated for expiration, conditions, and signature
- **Content-MD5 validation** — Server-side integrity verification on PUT rejects corrupted uploads
- **S3 Checksum API** — CRC32, CRC32C, SHA1, SHA256 checksums verified on upload and returned on download
- **Conditional request handling** — `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` ETag checks prevent lost updates (412 Precondition Failed)
- **Dependency hygiene** — Dashboard dependencies kept current against Dependabot advisories (latest: `react-router` 7.17.0 closing 6 alerts — turbo-stream RCE, RSC/Location XSS, `__manifest`/single-fetch DoS, protocol-relative open redirect)

## Tech Stack

- **Go** — net/http (no frameworks)
- **React 19** — Dashboard UI (embedded via `//go:embed`)
- **Tailwind CSS** — Dashboard styling
- **BoltDB** — Embedded key-value store for metadata
- **Local filesystem** — Object storage backend
- **AES-256-GCM** — Server-side encryption (SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS with HashiCorp Vault)

## Requirements

- Go 1.26+ (build)
- Node.js 20.19+ (dashboard build only — Vite 8 / Rolldown)
- No runtime dependencies

## Updating

VaultS3 can check GitHub Releases once a day and show a **dashboard banner** when
a newer version is out. Updates only ever replace the binary or image — your
object data, metadata, and config are never touched.

**Docker (recommended): [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/)** watches
for a new image and recreates the container; your data volumes are preserved:

```yaml
services:
  vaults3:
    image: eniz1806/vaults3:latest
    volumes: [vaults3-data:/data, vaults3-meta:/metadata]
  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    volumes: [/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock]
    command: --interval 86400   # check daily
```

**Binary / systemd:** enable the built-in updater in `vaults3.yaml`. With
`apply: true` it downloads the new release for your platform, **verifies its
SHA-256 checksum**, swaps the binary, and restarts into the new version
(checked daily; never auto-crosses a major version):

```yaml
auto_update:
  enabled: true     # daily check + dashboard banner
  apply: true       # also install automatically (omit for notify-only)
```

The current/latest version is also exposed at `GET /api/v1/version`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for build,
test, and PR guidelines, and **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** for release notes.

```bash
make build                      # React dashboard + server + CLI binaries
go test ./...                   # run the Go test suite
go test -race ./internal/erasure/ ./internal/cluster/ ./internal/replication/
```

The data-durability subsystems (`erasure`, `cluster`, `replication`) carry
fault-injection tests — corrupt a shard and heal it, lose a node and re-route,
partition two sites and resolve the conflict. New logic there should keep that bar.
